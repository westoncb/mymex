- Clean up and document code
	-convert to function components
	-clean up MemNode css
	-sort out and document DataStore.js

	- Search tags, maybe URLs
- Import folders
- Think about sync workflow: maybe just do it every 10 seconds
	- Show pop-up when new items are discovered during sync
- Get download fresh version to work
- Begin TypeScript re-write


Later:

- Need to either do some kind of filesystem watch for changes, or periodic re-scans or data sources to keep synced.

	For watching file system changes use https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_watch_filename_options_listener

	For initial recursive traversal use: https://www.npmjs.com/package/walkdir
