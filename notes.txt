- Clean up and document code
	-document things
	-fix warnings
	-clean up MemNode css

- Implement LocalDirectoryDSC
- Think about sync workflow: maybe just do it every 10 seconds
	- Show pop-up when new items are discovered during sync
	- Make it optional to actually delete items removed from data source (e.g. if I delete a bookmark in Chrome, I should be able to keep it in this app [perhaps it should become associated with faux/native/default "data source" at that point])
- Show annotations indicators in search results + button to show annotations panel
- Get "download fresh version" to work
- Begin TypeScript re-write


Later:

- Handle iframe page not loading errors

- Need to either do some kind of filesystem watch for changes, or periodic re-scans or data sources to keep synced.

- Highlight matched elements in search results, e.g. highlight the tags or title substrings that matched the search text.


- Search results pagination

	For watching file system changes use https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_watch_filename_options_listener

	For initial recursive traversal use: https://www.npmjs.com/package/walkdir


Ideas:
	- custom scrollbar component, showing a visual overview of results grouped into categories
